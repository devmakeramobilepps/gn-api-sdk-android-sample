# gn-api-sdk-android-sample

> A sample using [gn-api-sdk-android](https://github.com/franciscotfmc/gn-api-sdk-android)
provided by [Gerencianet](http://gerencianet.com.br).

This project has just one activity with an interface similar to a checkout page. The user enters his payment
data and clicks in the pay button. The event emitted will fetch a `paymentToken` in Gerencianet's API. With this token you're
capable of proceeding with the payment process in the backend.
